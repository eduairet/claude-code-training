# Claude Code first steps

## Getting started with Claude Code

- Check the [Claude Code official documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/) for installation and setup instructions.
- If you're using the CLI, you can start a new project by navigating to your project directory and running:

  ```bash
  cd path/to/your/project
  claude
  ```

- Now you can start claude with your project context loaded.

  ```bash
  /init
  ```

  - This will skim through your project files and build the initial context for your coding session.
